# Financial and Election data analysis with Python 



This repository contains Python scripts for two data analysis projects: **PyBank** and **PyPoll**, designed to showcase the use of Python for real-world financial and election data analysis.

## Overview
This project features two Python-based data analysis tasks:
- **PyBank**: A financial analysis tool that processes a dataset of profit/losses over time.
- **PyPoll**: A vote-counting tool for analyzing election data.

### Usage

To run the Python scripts, follow these steps:

Open your terminal or command prompt at the "analysis" folder
in the corresponding PyBank or PyPoll directory.



## Pybank

The PyBank project involves financial analysis over a period of 86 months to determine the following:

Total months

Total profit

The average change in profit

The greatest increase in profit

The greatest decrease in profit

To run the PyBank script, use the following command in your terminal:

python main.py

###Sample output analysis

```




## PyPoll

The PyPoll project analyzes a dataset with over 350,000 entries in a CSV file to determine the winner of an election. With the following being calculated
